 <h1>The Best Movies According to Phoebe</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Everything, Everywhere, All At Once</h3>
 <p>This is a good representation of different perspectives may clash whilst being a genre that can challenge our societal norms of the common hero and their mentality. When I first watched this, it felt quite chaotic, however, it drew me in to see a deeper messages of a variety of symbolism and imagery displayed so beautifully.</p>
 <h3>Meet the Robinsons</h3>
 <p>This was my favorite movie as a kid and while growing up. I must've watched this over 8 times. It always appeared as a featured movie on the Disney Channel on their programming so I as a child became immersed into the animation and story. I felt that this movie is quite underrated and not a common favorite amongst others. However, the themes of the possibilities of the future and the inventions that appeared were similar to what people imagined back then and are even creating now. Such as the flying car. Getting back to the main topic, this movie touched upon topics of orphanage, consequences, and had a great sense of humour mixed in as a kid who watched it religiously.

 <h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
 <p>I feel that everyone can agree that this was a momentous movie that captivated everyone. The animation and art was magnificent on its own, but the story helped bring it to life. Really enjoyable for all ages and gets it message across while adhering to standards that broke everyone's expectations. </p>
